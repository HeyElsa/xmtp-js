## üêû Bugs

Report a bug using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/issues).

## ‚ú® Feature Requests

Request a feature using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/issues).

## üîÄ Pull Requests

PRs are encouraged, but consider starting with a feature request to temperature-check first. If the PR involves a major change to the protocol, the work should be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-0-xip-purpose-process-guidelines/475) before work begins.

After a pull request is submitted, a single approval is required to merge it.

## üîß Developing

### Prerequisites

#### Node

Please make sure you have a compatible version as specified in `package.json`. We recommend using a Node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

#### Yarn

This repository uses the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/). To use it, enable [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack), if it isn't already, by running `corepack enable`.

### Useful commands

- `yarn`: Installs all dependencies
- `yarn build`: Builds all packages in the `/packages` folder
- `yarn clean`: Remove all¬†`node_modules`,¬†`.turbo`, and build folders, clear Yarn cache
- `yarn format`: Run prettier format and write changes
- `yarn format:check`: Run prettier format check
- `yarn test`: Run the unit test suite
- `yarn test:setup`: Start a local development node using Docker (only needs to be run once)
- `yarn lint`: Lint with ESLint
- `yarn typecheck`: Typecheck with `tsc`

### Testing and validation

Please add unit tests when appropriate and ensure that all unit tests are passing before submitting a pull request. Note that some unit tests require a backend node to be running locally. The `test:setup` command can be run a single time to start the node in the background using Docker.

Manual validation requires setting up a client app such as the [example app](https://github.com/xmtp/example-chat-react). Once you have cloned and run the example app, it will use a published npm version of `xmtp-js` by default. You can point it to your local `xmtp-js` repository by using `yarn link` or `npm link` from the `example-chat-react` directory, which will update its `package.json`. Once the example app is running, any further changes you make to `xmtp-js` will be reflected in the app after you run `yarn build` in the `xmtp-js` directory and then reload the app.

## üö¢ Publishing

This repository uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to publish updates. Pull requests must contain a changeset in order for changes to be published. The [changeset-bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) will guide you through this process.

### Beta releases

To begin development on a beta release, make sure the `beta` branch is up to date with the `main` branch. Create a new branch from the `beta` branch. After merging your changes into the `beta` branch, you must create a PR from the `beta` branch into the `releases/beta` branch. Once merged, a beta release will be published to the NPM registry.

After the beta period has ended, merge the latest `beta` branch into `main` to publish a production release with the changes.
